Aurora was the White Mage's attempt at finding the ultimate light. He discovered the truth that the world itself rejected perfection, that it would chain him down before allowing him to fix its imperfections, powerful as he may have been.

MapleStory is a weird game who is now old enough to drink in most countries. Along with that come many quirks in how its various mechanics interact. We can't eat up 2 other transcendents to absorb enough Erda to destroy the game engine and create a new one from scratch, so the best we can do is to study its imperfections to play around it as best we can.

### About the author

Level 271 Shadower main, MapleSEA Draco. Had a level 236 Ho Young in KMS Luna before NAVER channelling was discontinued (RIP amphy).

I have a YouTube channel where I uploaded some informational guides, some bossing, some hunting, and some pointless shit. But I've reached a point where video editing is an unfun drag and it gets tiring having old videos become irrelevant and unfixable as time goes on. So I figured a long-form informational blog would allow me to edit information as it comes.

Despite being in SEA, I do try to have a more global outlook on the game because being aware of the different situations in different servers grants insight into possible future directions in the game's roadmap. So I'll try to qualify as much information here with which server it's relevant too where I believe that mechanics may differ between regions.
